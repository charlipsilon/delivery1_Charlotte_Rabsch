    <h1>Background information about the planetary health diet</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Planetary Health Diet</strong> is part of a broader effort to address the intertwined challenges of human health and environmental sustainability. It is rooted in the idea that our food choices not only impact our personal well-being but also have far-reaching effects on the planet's ecosystems. The diet aligns with the principles of sustainable food systems, which advocate for reducing food waste, promoting biodiversity, and supporting ethical and sustainable farming practices. It also encourages the reduction of red meat and sugar consumption, both for health benefits and to lower the environmental footprint associated with animal agriculture and sugar production. </p>

    <p>The diet reflects a growing consensus among scientists, health professionals, and environmentalists that transformative changes in our dietary habits are crucial to achieving global health and sustainability goals, such as those outlined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
