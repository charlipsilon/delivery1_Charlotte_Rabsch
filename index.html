   <h1>Planetary health diet</h1> 
<h3>A balanced diet is not only good for our well-being, but also for our planet.</h3>
<h5><em>by Charlotte Rabsch</em></h5>

<p>The <strong>Planetary Health Diet</strong> presents a significant opportunity to address one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today: the simultaneous challenges of hunger and obesity. Currently, 738 million people worldwide suffer from hunger, while 1.8 billion adults are classified as overweight. In addition to these health issues, food production and consumption account for 30 percent of global CO2 emissions and are the leading cause of biodiversity loss.</p>

<p>Given this context, our approach to nutrition emerges as one of the most powerful levers for enhancing human health and promoting environmental sustainability. The <strong>Planetary Health Diet</strong>, developed by a team of scientists from the EAT-Lancet Commission, aims to harness this potential by proposing a sustainable dietary framework that could feed a projected 10 billion people healthily by 2050, all while minimizing environmental impact.</p>

<p>The diet recommends that 1/3 of the plate is made up of plant-based products. </p>
<p id="underline">The suggested foods include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whole grain products</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Fruits</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Pulses</li>
        </ol>

<p> This dietary guideline not only promotes better health outcomes but also significantly reduces the strain on our planet's resources. </p>

<p>By adopting the Planetary Health Diet, we can create a sustainable future where both human and planetary health are prioritized, ensuring a balanced and thriving world for generations to come.</p>
